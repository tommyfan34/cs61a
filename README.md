# UCB CS61A Fall 2020 solutions

fall 2020
course website: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa20/

finished all labs and homeworks except 
+ lab09 (midterm review), I think it's pretty challenging
+ lab12 (SQL)
+ hw09 (SQL)
+ lab13 (more SQL)

Basically all optional questions beside above assignments are finished (maybe 1 or 2 are left)
